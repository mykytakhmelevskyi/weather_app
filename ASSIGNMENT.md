# Task
Set up a simple weather application where you can search for a city and have the
weather presented visually. The sketch illustrates basic functionality, but you can
be creative or add more if you'd like.

Some elements that should be included:
- A build system such as webpack with npm / yarn
- A frontend / UI framework using React
- Integration with a weather API of your choice to do lookups / retrieve data
- Responsiveness. Reformat the design based on experience for larger and
smaller screens.
- The web application must be available online at a test URL
- Unit and integration specs

UX:
- Autocomplete search for cities with error handling
- List of recently searched cities and their weather/temperature
- Main weather and temperature should default to your current location (use the
method you think to produce the most accurate result with a reasonable
fallback mechanism)
- Whether you search for should display visually and the temperature

Criteria we consider:
- Best practice for the structure of code
- Use of new features and libraries
- Best practice for accessibility
- Ability to spot and add important elements/states missing in design
- Creativity and ability to elevate the solution through interactions and
visualization
